# MiniShell

This recreation of a shell lets you run al your favorite commands. It handles environment variables, moving directories, 
and the commands you expect in a regular shell. You can even run a minishell inside a minishell.

It is however lacking in support for arrow keys, autocomplete, and other helpfull tools. The goal of this project was
simply to understand the basics of how a shell works.
